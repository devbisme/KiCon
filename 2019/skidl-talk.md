## 1975

## Opamp

::: notes
But doesn't this schematic look nice?

* Simple components
* Shows what connects to what.
* left-to-right signal flow
* Clear circuit function:
    + Differential input stage
    + Level shifters
    + Totem-pole output driver

## 1981

## Microprocessor

![](microprocessor.png)

::: notes
* Tells what-connects-to-what
* Complex components with some well-defined I/O
* Back-and-forth signal flow between processor and memory
* Circuit function is hidden in software

## SOCs, FPGAs, Oh My!

![](vc707_1.png)

::: notes
* 2000-pin devices
* Massive integration of analog/digital blocks
* Wide buses / serial buses / packet comms
* Tells what-connects-to-what
* Too many wires => use stubs and labels
* Circuit function is no longer depictable

::: notes
Like James Joyce's "Finnigans Wake": only the author understands it and nobody else has gotten past page three.

## The Progression

* Started small and things worked great!
* Used a bit more, still OK.
* Used even more. Marginal results.
* Using heavily. No longer sure what's going on...

::: notes
* Similar to a drug addiction.

## But PHDL Died

![](phdl_forum_traffic.png)

::: notes
* As judged by forum traffic.
* https://sourceforge.net/p/phdl/mailman/phdl-devel/?viewmonth=201506
* Since the dawn of time, scavengers have learned the value of dead things...
:::

## <span style="font-size:40pt">Tasty and Doesn't Fight Back!</span>

![](roadkill_cooking.jpg)

## PHDL - the Tasty Bits

* Concise, repetitive part instantiation
* Concise, bulk connectivity
* Encapsulation
* Hierarchy

::: notes
If it's dead, better nose it to find out why...
:::

## Why Did PHDL Die?

* Very problem-specific
* Lacked general-purpose capabilities
* No ecosystem (libraries, utilities)
* No user community

::: notes
It's like a little girl in the desert.

## MyHDL

* Built upon a general-purpose language: Python
* Adds objects for describing digital hardware
* Provides a functional simulation engine
* Outputs VHDL or Verilog for synthesis

## PHDL + MyHDL &rarr; SKiDL

* Use Python for general-purpose computing
* Add *part* and *net* objects
* Provide methods for connecting them
* Output a netlist to PCBNEW

## Basic SKiDL Objects

* <span style="color:gold">`Pin`</span>: a terminal with a number, name, I/O type, ...
* <span style="color:gold">`Part`</span>: a bag of `Pin`s
* <span style="color:gold">`Net`</span>: a connection between one or more `Pin`s
* <span style="color:gold">`Bus`</span>: an array of `Net`s

## Start With a Part

<pre class="fragment sourceCode py"> >>> uc = Part('MCU_Microchip_PIC10', 'PIC10F220-IP')</pre>

<pre class="fragment sourceCode py"> >>> uc</pre>

<pre class="fragment sourceCode py" style="color:lime">PIC10F220-IP (PIC10F222-IP): 512W Flash, 24B SRAM, PDIP8
    Pin U1/2/VDD/POWER-IN
    Pin U1/3/GP2/BIDIRECTIONAL
    Pin U1/4/GP1/BIDIRECTIONAL
    Pin U1/5/GP0/BIDIRECTIONAL
    Pin U1/7/VSS/POWER-IN
    Pin U1/8/GP3/INPUT</pre>

## Create Nets

* `n = Net()`
* `n = Net('my_net')`
* `b = Bus('my_bus', 5)`

## Connect Pins and Nets

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color:gold">\[ \]</span> to access part pins and bus nets</li>
<li class="fragment"><span style="color:gold">+=</span> to connect stuff</li>
<li class="fragment">Pin to net: <span style="color:gold">`n += uc[5]`</span></li>
<li class="fragment">Pin to pin: <span style="color:gold">`uc[3] += uc[4]`</span></li>
<li class="fragment">Bus to part: <span style="color:gold">`b[3:0]+=uc['gp3,gp2,gp1,gp0']`</span></li>

::: notes
* A microcontroller sampling a voltage passed through a voltage divider.
* Every SKiDL statement corresponds to some element in the schematic.
* The effort to create SKiDL or schematic is nearly the same.
* The schematic is clearer.

* Encapsulate the previous example inside a function, and then
  call it twice to create two charlieplexed LED arrays.
* Demonstrates hierarchy/encapsulation and parameterization.
* The effort to create the SKiDL code is *much* less than the schematic.

## Generative Circuits

## Multi-Voltage Regulator

![](vreg_by_hand.png)

::: notes
* Connect the 8 resistors and 8 switches to generate as many, 0.1V-spaced voltages as
  possible with the adjustable regulator.

## Machine-Generated Version

![](vreg_by_machine.png)

::: notes
* I gave the machine a random arrangement of resistors and switches and said "make it better!"
* This is what it came up with.
:::

## Man vs. Machine

![](vreg_outputs.png)

::: notes
* Machine-generated circuit is slightly less clumpy.
* Machine-generated can handle less regular cases like unequal number of switches
  and resistors or different values of resistors.

## Documentation

* Python comments
* Doc strings, Sphinx and autodoc
* Attaching notes to circuits, parts, pins, nets, buses
* Jupyter

* Rich media: pictures, circuit diagrams, videos.
* Include live calculations in your notebook.
* Have your documentation generate your circuit.

So where have we ended up? I hope here. The little girl is surrounded by friends.
She's not the center of attention, but that was never the point.
They can play with her toy if they want, or they can do their own thing, if they want.
And that seems like a pretty good situation.
Except for this guy...
